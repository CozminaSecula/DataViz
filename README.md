# Data Visualization Projects

👋 Hi, I'm Cozmina, a freelance data professional specializing in data analysis and visualization.

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find:

- 📂 Source code for data visualizations based on year: [2024](https://github.com/CozminaSecula/dataviz/tree/main/2024)

- 🖼️ PNG files showcasing the visual output

- 📝 Step-by-step tutorials (for some graphics) on how to recreate the visualization

This repository serves as a portfolio of my personal projects, demonstrating my approach to turning data into visual stories.
